perf: multi-row INSERT for logs and summaries (~50x fewer IPC calls)

v0.2.5 - Fix log insertion stuck at 100/11,720 on Windows

Root cause: insertLogs was doing 11,720 individual INSERT statements,
each going through Tauri's IPC bridge. On Windows, each round-trip is
slow, so the sync would appear stuck.

Logs (attendance-log.repository.ts):
- Multi-row INSERT: 50 rows per SQL statement instead of 1
- For 11,720 logs: ~235 SQL calls instead of 11,720 (50x reduction)
- BATCH_SIZE increased to 500 per savepoint
- Progress reported per chunk (every 50 rows) for smooth updates

Summaries (sync-engine.ts generateSummariesFromLogs):
- CPU-first: compute all summaries in memory, then bulk-INSERT
- Multi-row INSERT ON CONFLICT: 1 SQL call per batch of 50 summaries
- For 1,650 summaries: ~33 SQL calls instead of 3,300 (100x reduction)
- Removed per-row upsertSummary call (which did INSERT + SELECT = 2 calls)
